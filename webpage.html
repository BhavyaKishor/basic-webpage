<h2>historical places in Cape Town</h2>

<span>

<div class="long">

  <h3>  Long Street</h3>

<p>
  <img src="/home/coder/Desktop/pictures/IMG_20180302_114628.jpg" alt=
  "me on long">
  1.Long Street could be described as the funkiest and loudest street in Cape
   Town, bustling with markets and boerewors
   roll stands during the day and hosting parties of all kinds once the sun sets.
Once the vintage clothing shops and designers alleys are closed, attention is
turned to the plethora of bars, restaurants, pubs and clubs lining this iconic
 road.
</p>
<p>2A word of caution; Whilst Long Street is busy on most nights, stay safe
   by not wondering off
  into quiet alleyways alone especially if you’re new to Cape Town .
This is one place in the city where cabs will be ever present, so if you’re
 drinking, get home safely by grabbing a cab..
  </p>
  <p>3.WHERE? Long Street, Cape Town Central, City Bowl

WHEN? Always happening

OVERNIGHT? See City Bowl accommodation, in Cape Town

<h3>  Bo-Kaap</h3>

<p> <div class="Kaap">
  <img src="/home/coder/Desktop/pictures/IMG_20180302_113539.jpg" alt="Bo-Kaap">
    </div>

1.It may be one of the most photographed areas of the Mother City,
  but brightly painted houses and quaint cobbled streets aren’t
  the only reasons to visit the Bo Kaap.
   This part of Cape Town is packed full of history and culture.</p>
<p>2.The earliest development in the Bo Kaap area was undertaken in the 1760s by
   a chap called Jan de Waal.
   Subsequently, the area became known as Waalendorp.
   It has also been known as the Malay Quarter,
   the Slamse Buurt, and Scotcheskloof.
   Translated from Afrikaans, Bo Kaap means ‘Above the Cape’.</p>
<p>3.Part of the Bo Kaap’s charm is the mix of Cape Dutch and Cape Georgian
  architectural styles. You can actually visit
  one of the oldest buildings in the Bo Kaap because
   it has been turned into a museum. The Bo Kaap Museum,
  which showcases local Islamic culture and heritage, was built by Jan de Waal in
   1768,
   and is the oldest house in the area still in its original form.
